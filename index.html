    <h3>Math 🧮</h3>
    <p>Math has been my <em>favorite</em> subject ever since I started school. I especially enjoy calculus and also love tutoring math--from addition to linear algebra!</p>


    <h3>Physics 💫</h3>
    <p>Physics is so difficult yet so fasinating. If I had to pick between Astronomy, Mechanics, and Electricity and Magnetism, I would go with E&M!</p>

    <h3>Programming 💻</h3>
    <p>Although I'm relatively new to programming, it has quickly become one of my favorite hobbies.</p>

    <h3>Classics 🏛️</h3>
    <p>Ever since I read the Percy Jackson series in 4th grade, I've been fascinated by the classics! Heres a piece of advice: you should definitely read the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the Aeneid (all three, in that order)!</p>

    <h3>Reading 📚</h3>
    <p>Reading is my other go-to pastime. My favorite genres include (but are not limited to 😉) Mystery, Classics, and Speculative Fiction. Make sure to check out my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/190545683-emily-fang">Goodreads</a>!</p>
